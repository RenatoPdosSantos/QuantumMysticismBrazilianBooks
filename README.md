# Detecting Quantum Mysticism in Books Published in Brazil with Data Science
Brazilian bookstores have been flooded with titles including the word 'quantum,' but more of 'quantum mysticism' flavour, which purports the existence of links between quantum mechanics and Eastern mysticism, leading to serious misunderstandings. This work aims to identify terms that can help readers, especially high-school teachers, to recognize to which of those categories a book pertains even before reading it through, contributing to breaking the vicious circle of students learning pseudoscience and passing it on as truth. 22 terms were identified that discriminate with an accuracy of 94% between the categories 'quantum mysticism' and science or science popularization.
